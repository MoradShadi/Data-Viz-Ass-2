    <h2 class="intro">This webpage explores fast food restaurants across the United States. Throughout this webpage you will find,
    a map displaying the geographic locations of fast food chains across different states; alongside some charts
  looking into a more statistical perspective related to these fast food chains. This is useful for anyone interested
in a visual representation of the distribution of major fast food restaurants in the US alongside the accompanying stats. </h2>

      <h2 class="text-right">The map on the left is a geographic layout of fast food restaurants across the United States. It is
      color coded by state for better clarity and differentiation especially in areas near state lines. It is
    quite visible that the eastern half of the US is more packed with fast food restaurants than the west.<br><br>
     The chart on the bottom
  left shows the count of fast food restaurants across the US according to provinces. The bubble chart on its right displays
the restaurants found in Hawaii as it is a popular state visited by tourists and locals. </h2>

  <h2 class = "text-left">The chart on the right is a heat map highlighting the frequencies of popular fast food brands across
    provinces. From the legend, the darker shade of blue corresponds to a higher number of branches of that restaurant in
    that given province. As the colour shade gets lighter, less branches are present. If a box is white, it means there are no
    branches at all in this province.
